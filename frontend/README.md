# Readable (Well it looks like it's a blog)

Readable is a project for udacity react nanodegree. It's basically a
blog like project. You can post post, and add comment. However there is
no user service yet, so right now it's more like I'm talking to myself.

## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository and use NPM to install the js dependencies.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tianhengzhou/readable_tianheng.git
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ cd ../server
$ npm install
```

## Usage

In a separate terminal start the server

```
$ cd server
$ node server.js

```

Use npm start to start the project.
```
$ cd frontend
$ npm start

```

# TODO
1. Add user service to this project so people can join.
2. Deploy to AWS
3. Add some tests for CI/CD
